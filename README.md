# Deep RL Zoo
Model Zoo for Deep Reinforcement Learning. Place for trained deep RL models, with focus on DQN and ALE.

# Models
Currently looking for trained models. If you have some consider contributing.

* https://github.com/tambetm/simple_dqn - DQN ALE implementation, using Neon. Has trained models for Breakout and Pong.

# Contributing
Depending on the size of your models you can either submit pull request with files/links or contact me directly via email. Please provide details about the training procedure (architecture, training parameters, link to the implementation).

For now there there is no specific format for those details; I will prepare one after several models are submitted.
